Session Description: There are only three programming paradigms. Structured Programming, Object Oriented Programming and Functional Programming. These paradigms didn't change since late 1960s. The rules of coding are the same since 1930. This course is a brief overview of what those rules are and how the modern programming languages enable programmers to leverage these to create applications.
